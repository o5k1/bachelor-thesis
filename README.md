This thesis describes the work I've done and the choiches I've made during my internship experience at [Digital Accademia](http://www.digitalaccademia.com/).

The main purpose was the refactoring of a CMS (Content Management System) used by the company and composed by:
- A MySQL database;
- A set of API REST which exposes all the functionalities to manage the database;
- A CMS UI.

The goals to reach was to maximize the system's modularity and minimize the coupling between components, in order to make the platform easily maintainable.
